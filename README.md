# Spring Data MongoDB Auditing

## Introduction

[**`Hibernate Envers`**](https://hibernate.org/orm/envers/) provides Auditing of JPA entities,
but no such library provides out of box support for Auditing MongoDB entities.
Auditing is a cross-cutting concern, should be kept separate from business logic and available to be applied
declaratively.

./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=docker'

./gradlew --stop
